# card_sdk

A new flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


1. 清空缓存。
2. 在文件 CHANGELOG.md 增加修改内容

flutter packages pub publish --dry-run
4. 修改命令行代理
set http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:10001
set https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:10001
不同系统设置命令行代理
powershell

export http_proxy='127.0.0.1:9999'
export https_proxy='127.0.0.1:9999'
cmd
set http_proxy='127.0.0.1:1080'
set https_proxy='127.0.0.1:1080'
